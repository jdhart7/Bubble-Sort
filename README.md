# Bubble-Sort

This program creates an array filled with "random" (technically not random because the modulo 'favors' certain numbers and the randomly generated number itself is generated by system time) numbers, then calls a header file that will sort those numbers using the bubble sort algorithm. This algorithm is only called once, just to show that it works. Due to the nature of this algorithm, the programmer would have to call it n-1 times to get the array completely sorted if it were a "worst case senerio." The algorithm is in a header file so both programs are modular and can be used with either a different algorithm, or the algorithm can be used on a different main file.
